# Module_5_Topic_3_Exiting_While_Loop_Assignment
 Recall your input_while.py, make a copy called input_while_exit.py. What if the user typed bad input because they wanted to quit the entire program? The algorithm as written does not account for that. You could add code to exit (aka break out of) the inner while if the user input a sentinel flag indicating they no longer have input. Implement this option by adding the appropriate exit statement to the inner while loop.  Run the code. Notice that the code does not exit the outer while loop. There are a few ways to fix the code so it will exit this loop as well. Fix the code. Add doctring to the top of your file, add comments at the bottom with your tests and observed output after a few test runs of your code. Submit your input_while_exit.py.  Additional Note: Said another way, we are  essentially using what we have learned above and modifying out old code to use a 'break' statement to exit the loop when a sentinal value matches. This will prevent the rest of the code in the loop from running. In our code example, this doesn't save us much time as the break has us only skip ~10 lines of code. However, if we had thousands of lines of code/checks left in the inner loop; that break statement would save us tons of time.
